Material Calendar 
======================

A Material design back port of Android's CalendarView. The goal is to have a Material look
and feel, rather than 100% parity with the platform's implementation. The goal of this project is to rewrite original library in kotlin and make it more extendable and flexible.

Customization
-------------

One of the aims of this library is to be customizable. The many options include:

* [Define the view's width and height in terms of tile size](docs/CUSTOMIZATION.md#tile-size)
* [Single or Multiple date selection, or disabling selection entirely](docs/CUSTOMIZATION.md#date-selection)
* [Showing dates from other months or those out of range](docs/CUSTOMIZATION.md#showing-other-dates)
* [Setting the first day of the week](docs/CUSTOMIZATION_BUILDER.md#first-day-of-the-week)
* [Show only a range of dates](docs/CUSTOMIZATION_BUILDER.md#date-ranges)
* [Customize the top bar](docs/CUSTOMIZATION.md#monthIndicatorView-options)
* [Custom labels for the header, weekdays, or individual days](docs/CUSTOMIZATION.md#custom-labels)
